                <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Zain, a student at Queen's University, where I'm currently exploring Computer Science, Statistics, and Mathematics. My passion lies at the intersection of AI, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction, where I am constantly working to push the boundaries of technology.
            
                <br><br> At Queen's, I've been able to work on a variety of projects and design teams, each enriching my understanding and application of tech. From developing algorithms for autonomous vehicles in Queen's AutoDrive, to exploring image-to-text caption generation with QMIND, my journey is about applying what I learn in the classroom to tangible, impactful projects.

                <br><br>In the ever-evolving world of Artificial Intelligence, my interest extends beyond academia. I avidly follow current research and breakthroughs in AI and ML, with a keen eye on how these advancements shape our understanding of technology and its ethical implications. My goal is to be at the forefront of this change, contributing innovative ideas to enhance human-computer interaction and advocate for responsible AI development.

                <br><br>Thanks for visiting my website. Itâ€™s a window into my professional and academic experiences and an insight into the projects that feed my enthusiasm for innovation and ethical tech development. Feel free to connect with me at zain.parihar@gmail.com!</p>
