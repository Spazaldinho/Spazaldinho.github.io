# Zain's Personal Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website, hosted at [Zain's Website](https://Spazaldinho.github.io). This site showcases my work experience, design team involvements, projects, and coursework. It's a reflection of my journey in computer science and technology.

## Design Philosophy

The design of this website is inspired by a trend I noticed among successful individuals in my industry: the use of simple, minimalistic web designs. This approach not only enhances readability but also aligns with a professional and straightforward aesthetic. I've chosen a dark mode theme for its visual appeal and reduced strain on the eyes, making it comfortable for extended browsing. Additionally, I've incorporated subtle fading animations to smooth out the rendering of the website, adding a touch of elegance without compromising speed and efficiency. The minimalist design ensures optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience across various platforms.
